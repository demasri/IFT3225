Example of an application support email

Your cover letter and CV form the heart of your application. If you are applying via a job posting site, Cadremploi for example, you will not need to accompany your application with an email. Conversely, if your application is spontaneous or if the recruiter's contact details appear in the job posting directly, you will need to write an email to accompany your application. Taking care of this email is therefore essential: it constitutes the first lines that the employer will read from you. We give you some tips for successfully completing this often overlooked step.

The subject of the email accompanying your application must be precise
Take care of your email subject to make a recruiter want to click. Don't send an irrelevant email, it could be forgotten. Be specific and always remember the exact job title. Think ahead to find the perfect subject for an application.

Example: Application for the position of "job title" (and specify the reference number of the job offer if it is present in the advertisement).

Application support email: take care of your few lines
Your accompanying email should not be too long, contain no spelling errors and should make the recruiter want to find out about your application. Be careful not to repeat your cover letter.

The message begins by soberly addressing the recipient. If we know his name, we will be satisfied with a sober "Madame," or "Monsieur," depending on the gender. If your email lands in a box shared by a department, take the precaution of starting with "Madam, Sir,".

In the body of the email, include the job title you are applying for, where you found it, and state that you are applying.
