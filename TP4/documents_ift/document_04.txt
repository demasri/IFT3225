An electric cella, colloquially known as cell1, is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy through a chemical oxidation-reduction reaction.


The term “battery” designates an assembly of identical elements (in parallel or in series), unlike the battery which designates the stacking of torque (different metals + insulator) in order to obtain the desired voltage (we can then put their battery cells to obtain the desired characteristics). If the elements assembled together are accumulators they form an accumulator battery
But sometimes we find the expression for a battery of cells, to describe the assembly of these components.

In the automotive industry, the term an “accumulator battery” is often simplified to “battery”, which is incomplete.

There are archaeological objects, like those found in 1936, resembling piles. This is the case of the Baghdad electric battery which is dated between −250 and 250 although they could be older and would explain the so perfect plating of many ancient jewelry so light.
A lithium-ion battery, or lithium-ion accumulator, is a type of lithium battery.

Its main advantages are a high specific energy (two to five times more than nickel metal hydride for example) as well as the absence of memory effect. Finally, the self-discharge is relatively low compared to other accumulators. However, the cost remains high and has long confined lithium to small systems
